1. How did you implement multi-tenancy in NestJS?

I implemented multi-tenancy by separating data using organizationId.

Each user belongs to one organization. Every request sends the organizationId in the header. I store this organizationId in all tables like Issue and ActivityLog.
Whenever I fetch or update data, I always check the organizationId.

Because of this, users from one organization cannot see or change data of another organization.

2. Where does authorization logic live and why?

Authorization logic is written inside the service, not the controller.

Controller only receives the request and sends it to the service.
In the service, I check the user role.

For example:

Only ADMIN can update issue status

Only ADMIN can delete issues

This makes the application more secure and avoids mistakes in future.

3. How do you prevent cross-organization data leaks?

I prevent data leaks by checking organizationId every time.

Steps I follow:

Every table has organizationId

Every database query filters by organizationId

If organizationId does not match, data is not returned

Even if someone tries to use another issue ID, they will not get the data.

4. What would need to change if the system grows very large?

If the system grows very large:

SQLite will be changed to PostgreSQL

Pagination will be added for large data

Indexes will be added for better performance

Activity logs will be handled in background

The basic design will stay the same.

5. What features did you skip and why?

Some features were skipped because of limited time:

Login and authentication

Automated testing

Pagination and filtering

Deployment setup

I focused more on backend logic, security, and correct architecture.
